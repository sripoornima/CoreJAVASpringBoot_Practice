CoreJAVASpringboot 
This is my personal journey to brush up, explore, and practice Java concepts every single day.  
I’ll be uploading one topic per day – from the basics to the cool Java 8+ features.  
Inside each folder, you’ll find code snippets, explanations (sometimes 😜), and little experiments.

## 🙌 Why I’m Doing This?
- To stay persistent with daily coding  
- To make my fundamentals stronger  
- To have a nice reference repo for myself and others  

## 🤝 How You Can Use This
- Clone or fork the repo  
- Check out the code for each day  
- Run it, break it, tweak it, learn with me
