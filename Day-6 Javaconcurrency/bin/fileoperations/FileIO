The basic package for file operations in Java is java.io.
We use the Scanner class for reading inputs from a file instead of the usual System.in.
While creating the Scanner object, we pass the file path using a File object.
Steps for reading from a file:
Create a File object with the file path.
Pass the File object to the Scanner constructor.
Use hasNextLine() to check whether there is more content.
Use nextLine() to read the file line by line.
Normally, System.in is used for console inputs, but here we are using a file object.
If the file does not exist at the mentioned path, a FileNotFoundException occurs.
We must use exception handling (try-catch or throws) for safety.
For writing to a file, we use the FileWriter class.
Methods in FileWriter:
write(String) → writes data to the file.
close() → always close the file after writing, otherwise changes may not be saved.
Summary of important classes:
File → represents the file or directory path.
Scanner + File → used for reading content from a file.
FileWriter → used for writing content into a file.
Always remember to close the file after reading or writing.
